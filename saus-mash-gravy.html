    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some lovely spuds</li>
        <li>Salted Butter</li>
        <li>Sausages <em>(Veggie</em> or <em>Meat)</em></li>
        <li>Gravy Granules</li>
        <li>Sea Salt</li>
        <or><li>White Onions <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>Brown Sugar <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </or>
    </ul>
    <h2>Let's Get Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the spuds into nice 1" cubes (personally I prefer skin-on so I will omit pealing the spuds), and chuck them into some boiling water for 10 mins or until nice and soft.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>
                (Optional step)<br>
                Splash of olive oil, sliced white onion, good pinch of sugar. Let fry on a low heat while you wait on the spuds/sausages.
            </em>
        </li>
        <li>
            Get the sausages cooking in the oven with a nice drizzling of olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once your spuds are nice and soft its time to drain, add a good huck of butter, crack of salt and get mashing till silky smooth. (Add more butter/salt to preference) (Add half the caramelized onions if you decided to fry some up)
        </li>
        <li>
            Whack some boiling water in with your gravy granules to get a nice thick gravy (If you decided to caramelize those onions nows the time to add half to the gravy)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Big dollop of mash</li>
        <li>Three sausages sticking out of mash</li>
        <li>Swamp plate with gravy</li>
