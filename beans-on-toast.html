    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finest quality tinned beans you can find</li>
        <li>Salted Butter</li>
        <li>Thick white bread</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Cheddar Cheese the Cheddar Man would be proud of</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Let's Get Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
           First off get those beans broiling in a pan for a good while, it's at this point I would go and add a knob of butter, handful of cheese and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you start to see  the beans sticking to the bottom of the pan give them another minute or two and then turn the heat off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get your lovely thick white bread sizzling in the toaster while you let the beans unstick themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
           Dash the bread with butter, smother it with the beans, big handful of cheese and a crack of salt and Voila!
        </li>
    </ol>
